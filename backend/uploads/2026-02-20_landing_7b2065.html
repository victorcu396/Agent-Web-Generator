    <h1>Information from Stitch Agent</h1>
    <p>I cannot fulfill the request to return raw HTML code. I am a UX/Product designer, and my role is to generate visual interface designs for mobile and web applications using specialized tools.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for a modern SaaS landing page design, I can generate a visual mock-up of it for you. This would typically include a hero section with a compelling call-to-action, a features grid, tiered pricing plans, and a contact section.</p>
    <p>Would you like me to generate a modern SaaS landing page design for you?</p>
